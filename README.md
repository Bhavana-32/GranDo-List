# 🧶 GranDo List
*A To-Do List App That Loves You Enough to Nag You*  

## 👵 About  
Remember how grandma never let you forget your homework, chores, or to eat before going out? This app brings that same sweet persistence into your productivity.  

**GranDo List** is a to-do list app that doesn’t just help you organize tasks, it *lovingly nags you until you’re done*. Whether it’s a deadline, a workout, or watering your plants, grandma’s got your back (and your schedule).  

## ✨ Features  
- 📝 Add, edit, and delete tasks  
- 🔔 Persistent reminders until tasks are completed  
- 🎙️ Grandma-style messages: *“Did you finish, dear?”*  
- 💾 Local storage so your tasks don’t disappear  
- 🎨 Cozy, grandma-inspired UI  

## 🎯 Why This App?  
Most to-do apps are polite. Too polite.  Or too *complicated*.
This one’s like grandma, she means well, but she *will* check in again and again until you finish.
